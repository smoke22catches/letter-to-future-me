# Letter to future me

The aim of this project is to create an application, that allows users to write letters to their future selves. The app will have both free and paid versions. The free version will allow users to write letters and set a date for when they want to receive the letter. Hovewer, in free version the date of receiving the letter cannot be set to more than 1 year in the future. The paid version will allow users to set the date of receiving the letter to any date in the future. Also in paid version users will be able to read the letters they have written in the past.
